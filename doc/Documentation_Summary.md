## How to Generate Documentation

### Prerequisites
Install Doxygen on your system:

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install doxygen graphviz

# CentOS/RHEL
sudo yum install doxygen graphviz

# macOS
brew install doxygen graphviz
```

### Generate Documentation
```bash
cd /workspace
doxygen Doxyfile
```

The generated documentation will be available in:
- **HTML**: `./.doxy/html/index.html`
- **LaTeX**: `./.doxy/latex/`

### View Documentation
Open `./.doxy/html/index.html` in a web browser to view the complete API documentation.

## Key Benefits Achieved
